  description: "Every now and again new Lycans shapeshift and join the ranks of the Tribe. Each Lycan is unique, in shape, detail or color and is handdrawn and coloured. Lycans come in all shape and sizes, and the project explores the boundaries between being human and being animal. Welcome to the Lycans."

  description: "Lycan labs is collection that will serve as a playground, my playground specifically, for everything I want to touch on that isn't 'Lycan' per se. A space to experiment, a laboratory! It will contain series of all sorts, but also 1/1s of several topics. It will be a collection with a lot of variation and will not per se, seem consistent. No AI is used in creating the artwork."
