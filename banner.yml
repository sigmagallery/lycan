title: Lycan Trope
description: Every now and again new Lycans shapeshift and join the ranks of the Tribe. Each Lycan is unique, in shape, detail or color and is handdrawn and coloured. Lycans come in all shape and sizes, and the project explores the boundaries between being human and being animal. Welcome to the Lycans.
